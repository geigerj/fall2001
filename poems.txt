Thanks Dad.
For my life,
and my way
you defended it
as a young man
risked your life
and won.

Now you are gone
suddenly and finally
say hello to mum for me
give her my love.
I miss you both.

An empty house
with sudden reminders
a half eaten waffle
and an unread newspaper.

RIP Dad.

How to rape a Sikh

Boy, I want to cut your hair off.
I gave you my only body
then you took away my heart.

Since you are a man of god,
a young god with bright eyes,
I know how you love your hair.

The next day you hold me
like Brutes with scissors
Ill take away your mane--

and well be even then
hairless man, empty woman
both at last naked.

At last free
to cry or love.

Give me a man who regards me well.
I don't want endless passion and tears,
or to worry about you enlisting.
No tempertantrums at the coffee house,
no jealous glances, no goddamned roses,
just a dry regard, like for a good book.

Give a man that I can regard.
I don't want to call you each time we part,
or think of you while waiting for the train.
no crying into the pillow when you go
no hating HER and her very nice ass
just a quiet smile, as I turn your pages.

Pink perfection


> One safety note when working with melons is to always wash

I went
to her place
late and unannounced.
She was quite surprised
to see me again after the years
of oblivion in fun and decadence,
and did really do her best to please me
with a creative potluck dessert party,
serving me a glass of appeal
between two ripe, aromatic
melons on an expensive
silver tray.

For that night, and only for that night, I decided to be polite,
and not a pervert squirt.
Firstly I touched the sweet dessert
- her fruits were swish and nice -
and then I took a gentle slice.
For this I used a special knife, while she was praying for her life.

I couldn't stay
much longer. I got pensive.
Recalling a highly traumatic
past, under the sway of her squeal,
I realized that I could not be hearty
to her anymore. I started to cry, while she
felt sorry for her loss of magnificence.
She did not care about my tears.
Was I the one to be chastised
for the love she renounced
in disgrace?
I went.

We are incompatible
And it would be quite unpleasant
And forced sex is as despicable
On Barnobukan as on Earth

Stagnate empathy stills the air
in windless weeps of endless
fears;

Souls to sadness cry with tears;
left to frame the void,
for if we heard, some lonely
noise;

Disposed to prey the emptiness
vague;
rent is ears to say the voice
and said;
is clamorous and vanished;

Then, stopped is time and pain,
numb to a daze;
but done, is the damage.

Dragged along furiously,
from heavy horses,
in the dust of a galloping 
of sharp tongues,
through thickets
of razor blade points,
considered argument,
as to how it ought to be,
about choosing differently
until there is no real choice,
pulled across the edge
of all endurance
onto fakir beds of well honed losses,
a twenty-first century stigmata,
experiencing the heart of it all
torn from between the ribs,
crushed under muck raking
of insidious little details
that obscure any true intentions,
then the bursting as a red balloon
into another new collapse
as to any meaningful signals,
and what was a moment of vision
flares out 
into the pitched dark
of tomorrows of strangers,
who only laugh
if they see the slightest symptom
of emotional trauma.

 and never make amends,
 and you who never take their part
 though with their wine your gut is large
 but would betray their generous heart, 
 what say you to this charge?
 If it seems to you the grave's not nice &c

 But you who as you leave your host
 and get up on unsteady legs
 have never once returned his toast
 though sucking dry his kegs,
 deny such guests all food and wine
 and show them grimly to the door,
 snatch from their lips their goblets fine
 and throw them to the floor. 
 If it seems to you the grave's not nice &c
 
 Now finally, if you're well pleased
 your coat and hat you will retrieve
 as all the guests are now released
 to humbly take their leave.
 But first with wine both red and white
 your host salute and then embrace,
 then stumble out into the night
 to slip into your graves.
 If it seems to you the grave's not nice 
 then just have a drink and don't think twice,
 then have one and have two and again make it three
   and die more happily!

He staggers to the chair.
The third Ambien he took
made him clumsy but not sleepy.
The quest began six hours ago,
supine in bed, staring at the ceiling,
the chainsaw sounds of children running in and out
of the gate near his window.
What are the little bastards doing up at 1 am anyway?
Aren't there curfews laws on school nights?
Silly him, these kids are drop-outs.
Perhaps an Ambien will help.
The mellifluous tones of Art Bell tune out
the god awful cacophony from outside.
Art keeps speaking, talking, vocalizing,
What the hell kind of radio is this?
They just sit and yammer about conspiracies?
Silly him, it's talk radio.
Perhaps an Ambien will help.
Someone standing right at the window,
behind the horizontal blinds, motionless.
Heart racing, what does he do about a burglar?
The revolver on the nightstand isn't even loaded!
Must remember where he put the ammo.
Silly him, the shadow is gone already.
Perhaps an Ambien will help.
What was the maximum recommended dose
of Ambien again?  One pill?!?
The room shimmers pleasantly,
shadows in the corner take on a third dimension.
Books in the shelf sway back and forth as if a gust
of wind has taken them.
The sun is rising, time to give up on sleep.
Time to get back on the computer.
He staggers to the chair.
The third Ambien he took
made him clumsy but not sleepy.

Sexual Alphabets
----------------

It was late,
so very late
for anything,
and a scattering of fingers
had been left,
as curled up digits,
disjointed motions,
strewn haphazardly,
reflex reactions,
across the keyboard.
They had consumed away
their corroded knuckles,
trying to find the formula
that would connect
desires and satisfactions,
the way a catalyst
connects chemicals
into new compounds,
releasing energy
from where it binds
various elements,
as to who we wanted to be
before becoming worn away
in an eventual erosion 
of our sexual alphabets
into another loss of words.
Perhaps in the morning
there might be an answer
instead of only another day
that is being stretched out
and consumed slowly,
in a vast multitude
of unsatisfying ways.

---------------------

Hunched
-------

As hunched 
as the bent of the moon,
a stretched bow
lingering on the edge
of obscurity,
having lost its arrow
in some long ago myth,
the way a half crippled arm
reaches to stopping short
of rising to the occasion
then descends exhausted
into the limp silence
of any immediate horizon.
The shade of an earthen rise
protrudes,
a winged scapula,
into the folds of night.
That one shoulder 
elevated beyond the reach
of the other,
and both thrown 
across the sheets
as that rolling hillside
beside the deep valleys
of the meandering spine.
Hair tossed back loosely
the way spindly thickets
and thin curling vines
are gathered in tangles
of midsummer mind,
grown sleepy with whispers
from underground breaths,
awaiting that restlessness
as was always kept waiting
stuffed under the pillows
hidden beside the bed,
knowing something 
pulls at the pelvis
as though there is a soul,
in that melting away of sense
at the base of a column,
something contained
within that bowl,
the way sacrificial oceans are
held between prominences,
hardly feeling 
any further connection,
to that kind of barrenness
as seems to extend
in the very same way 
as the light of the moon
extends itself as far
as any of the walls.

My eyes shut, in bed, I felt, I heard, I knew.
It was cool between the sheets on your side.
You'd snuck in your sneakers on the shag
and slowly zipped all your bags.
You had hopes I'd remain undisturbed.
First just my belly had the balls to believe
now is always September 23rd, pedestrian, solo.

My eyes, more courageous than Prometheus, peeked.
Then, where you blocked the light from entering our room
got stuck in my eyes' mind like a liver.

My eyes closed as you approached.
I snored in your scent.
You almost didn't kiss me.
Instead of saying I wanted you to stay,
I sighed.

There are only three tracks in this dirt road
None of 'em are ghost's
Though you might've heard otherwise
Anything is possible I s'pose
But I don't think there are any ghosts
Never more'n three or four tracks
Mostly family, rarely deliveries
The oak at the crest of the third hill
From the town road can be spooky
Especially in certain moonlight
And the empty mansion
On Catchwood Hill
Needs keepin' bad
Seems like it's always next month
Someone's gonna buy it
And next month never comes
But I doubt Grampa Wilson drives 'em off
He's dead over twenty years, ya know
There are no ghosts, I don't believe
Most sensible folks jus' worry
'Bout too many places for underage drinkers
Out in their parent's cars
What am I s'posed to do?  Shoot 'em?
I tol' ol' boy Zeke
He could drive his squad car
Up there anytime
He usually just shines his searchlight
On 'em and they run on home
But if his daughter is ever
In one of the cars
I hope I'm on the other side of Maysville
When that happens
But it won't on account of her good sense
If more young 'uns would make use of the library
As much as she does
The world would be saved, I guess
Nothing of account on this old dirt road
We talk about ghosts
Just to pass the time sometimes
You know how that goes
Little happens
Without one of Cantrell's horses lose again
Nothin' happens worth gettin' excited over
Do you know any ghost stories?

Translation of Marina Tsvetayeva

===========================================

I like it that you're burning not for me,
I like it that it's not for you I'm burning
And that the heavy sphere of Planet Earth
Will underneath our feet no more be turning
I like it that I can be unabashed
And humorous without mincing words much
And not to redden with a smothering wave
When my sleeves to your own lightly touch.

I like it, that before my very eyes
You calmly hug another; it is well
That for me also kissing someone else
You will not threaten me with flames of hell.
That this my tender name, not during day nor night,
You will recall again, my tender love;
That never in the silence of the church
They will sing 'halleluiah' us above.

With this my heart and this my hand I thank
You that - even in spite your power -
You love me thus; and for my peaceful nights
And for rare meetings in the sunset hour,
That we aren't walking underneath the moon,
That sun is not above our heads this morning,
That you - alas - are burning not for me
And that - alas - it's not for you I'm burning.

Flattery of the Light

I'm pulling into drugstores
during afternoon rush hour
on a hot & humid August First
to buy a Timex watch
with three hands and the date

It stays light into night in August
it's November when it loses most
it's when everybody notices

In August we notice the passions of summer
germinated during spring and its fancies
I sip a Guinness on the porch, smoke my own-rolled tobacco
and wonder about some things before dark

In June she showed me Wyatt's poem They Flee from Me,
how odd that he should use the word newfangleness
five hundred years ago

In five hundred years a man can grow white hairs
become untoothed, and begin to forget why he is here
until a wanderlust will snap him back
to where he was, spins him thrice around
and points him out there in the right direction
to start again, believe again,
to stop the ceaseless brooding while the light fades

Was he the first 
to cross the desert
to save the human race?

We all have the craziness

Flip the right switch
we'll try to save the world
with a book or a song

think I will sing the music of heaven
light spilling out of my nose and eyes
and ears and from my ass even and my cunt.
I'll be a human disco ball

and when you turned-off people
hear my bright music
popping like light balls
off of a glass of water
you will be turned on too.
you will find the long road
that before death 
you must walk.

            PIECES IN THE PUZZLE
             By ... Steve Lucky

Each piece in a jigsaw puzzle has its own distinguishing features.
Each location on Earth has its own distinguishing creatures.
When connected together, a picture is created.
The proper place for each piece can be located
By looking at the picture as a whole
Or detected the pattern where age takes its toll.
As the pieces become worn and thin,
Renewed spirit comes from within.
It takes a delicate touch
When the pieces seem too much.
Gently the pieces are put in place
Until one can see a human face.

     AIMING FOR THE SKY
     By ... Steve Lucky

Changing the world is hard to do
To make a difference, one must try,
Always aiming for the sky
So the task can be carried through.
Some are opposed to such a view,
Even those on whom one will rely.
Such a thing no one should deny.
It is enough to make one blue.
All power can become corrupt.
When one picks a difficult task
Normal life is rearranged
Just to answer the questions people ask.
If one's temper starts to errupt,
The course of action needs to be changed.

                POWER
          By ... Steve Lucky

As one gets older, power is gained.
In personal success one can not bask
Until this power is contained.
Even someone who wears a mask
Can not hide from his or her actions.
This is the price of greater authority.
One should not be too concerned worried about reactions
When the task at hand has higher priority.
Better ways and needed to keep things in control.
With experience this need becomes easier to fill.
New found power effects the soul
To master it requires practice and skill.
New found power can destroy.
Still most people want to have it to enjoy.

Once in a Blue Moebius Band

Over here in 2001
I hear from 1962
the John Coltrane Quartet's Ballads
Coltrane playing me hearing
without irony Too Young to Go Steady

Here again
I hear a swarm of nylon baggy

from can't drive yet too young
moving to those winged grasshoppers

like it's a IV co-neck-shun to the ears
he's got a envy for the dudes
and their nuke UVs hood kaboomers

got a subwoofer strapped on his back asswards

the thump blow out his bass

The glitter in the diamond lights

recession to a torchlit cave

where beast drags beauty fair

He is satisfied that she

"So mad that my blood starts a goin'"

I snuggle up to concrete
Wrapped in city street
Dead leaves, trash,
Trodden under so many feet.

I cuddle in the dirt and
The wind is my radio
My eyes are my TV.

I watch the machine people
As they change reality.

I dwell among the shadows
Buildings skyscrapers skylines
Wires, pipes, metal, plastic.
Always shifting light chases.

Attempts to love;
So inadequate and
Recoiled from by
So many.

Sit alone as I do,
Most every night.
Smoke the only friend
I have left.
Pray for my mother.
Pray for the world.

Try not to think about
The (screaming) past.
Try to work harder for
(Greater goodness in.)
The future.

Most of the time
Mindful watching,
Dust and leaves.
Wires and the city
Snuggled in the
Stolen landscape,
Squeezing drunken
And crippled
Sioux and Cheyenne injuns
Through the cracked
Sidewalks
To show me how well I
Live, compared to them.
So I can feel better because
Instead of being me,
I could be a victim
Of me.  (waseechu)

The insects of my mind
Crawl slowly over their meal
Of dried and mouldering wood.

Please can I have a penny?
I'll paint your house.
Fix your gate.
To get your filthy fucking money.
To eat.
To live in
The hole where
I was born.

And watch you get in your
Porsche.  As I clean your
Statues and hot tubs.

I think about how your children
Have tutors, all the best tools.
How I didn't even have parents
I could trust.  How I sat in school,
All those years hoping, someone
Would show some of that care,
You only see in the movies.
The kind teacher that notices
The languishing mind...

Instead I got teeth knocked
Out on water fountains.
Shoved daily in hallways.
Mocked and derided every day.
Because I wouldn't fight back.
Because of my ugly skin.
Because I had a funny name.
Just because I had a funny name.

God, how I'd like to get those
Evil rich bastards and their monstrous
Fucking children.

Yeah, your fucking kid;
That you think is so perfect.

I'd take the arrogant little snot,
Tie them to a chair and say,
"From now on YOU are going
To be spit on, YOU are going to be
Treated like shit, and recoiled from
By those lilly white fucks in
Convertibles and alarmed houses."

Then I'd burn the fuckers face
So the only hope he'll ever have,
Of seeing kindness again,
Will be from good people,
And kind, dirty, injured
People that the rich don't look at,
As they cross the street in front of
Their cars.

Anti-terrorist measures sow distrust;
citizens see government intruding,
  ostensibly on their behalf, like Dads
  who know best; some wonder when it's their turn
  to become targets because they vote wrong
  or pray different from those owning tools
  which detect deviances from State's norm;

dissent squelched manifests as dissension
  in times following catastrophes, wars;
equilibrium's sought, pendulums stop,
commons weal what clerks wrought, balance begins
  before checks are analyzed by scholars; 

firemen finish being heroes, a few
linger limp, loiter long at ground zero;
some seem opportunists, but they're human;
  (folks revert to type when a crisis ends)
dozens feel they've no better place to be;
others want no one "spelling" what they do; 
these need to pick through rubble where it's safe;
  (men cry; women mourn; dead get dignity)
but budgets are going out of control,
cranes collide with cherry-pickers, crush toes
  of excess sorters in claw-grabber's way;

rule makers intervene; restore order,
but riots erupt when states interrupt
  a process man deems essential: grieving;
speeches follow arrests when cops are hit;
palliatives prevail; "safety" is stressed,
but clearing resumes governed by dictates
  because commerce matters, grief must give way;
men must accept: no one pays the idle
  unless they own labor laws and machines;
rituals end when purposes are served;
nothing's personal; it's merely business.

Freedom of speech may take a hit when laws
  well-intended go too far to curb crime;
those who dwell on what was or ought to be
  step back so their government may be free
  to do whatever it takes for "safety"
and men must accept: no one may dissent
  when rulers decree what is best for them
  during an emergency and after
  crows arrive to clear disaster's debris.

The "feeling bad" few may be swept aside, 
  but they will remember and get even;
the nature of man seeks stranger balance,
  witness tall twin towers torn asunder
  by revenge gone awry in those idle,
but this inclination bodes well for speech
  as citizens begin to question "truths"
  about why towers fell, who allowed Hell
  and when rules changed to benefit owners.

Were Keynes alive, he'd say: change course, invest

  spend on infrastructure and bold research
  on hydrogen fuel cells, not more oil wells,
  on sun, wind and salt flats made dead by greed,
but Samuelson, Cheny and Emir-Khans
  call the shots for simple shrubs, savages
  and despots dependent upon God's plan
  which mandates more now for them and their heirs
  and no socialistic sharing of wealth,
  but a promise of life in here's after
  for the observant-obedient who leave no legacy
  like that they found when they were born needy
  of a culture built on make do, do without
  and save some for rainy days, relatives
  who will inherit the future; Keynes knew
  government spending in recessions meant
  recovery from multipliers and hammers
  sharpened sickles and built a Hoover dam;
  his macroeconomics trickled up
  defying the old world order for haves
  guided by noblesse oblige to endow
  Institutes which provided poor housing

  and crossings children skip through in a race
  with locomotives leading faster trains
  no brain imagined between LA and Las Vegas, Budd-lite
  traveling all day, all night vice busses dieseling
  from senior centers to bright casinos named Mirage

  from wrong with a song about alpha's bet in hot soup
  and shoup-shoup, hey, baby, I don't mean maybe,
  I mean hey, hey, ho, ho, this gang's got to go;

splay rail, repair schools and make citizens
  no tool-fools for a change; confess tax cuts
  are not substitutes for spending better,
  say the future matters more than rewards
  for lobbyists and creepy committees
  controlling elections and supreme courts.

The poet piles a paean, but the words
Do not add up to singing from one face;
Some dozen noises clamor for a place
In which to try their voice above the herd's.
The "epic" swells with seconds (even thirds),
But seldom well enough that we can trace
The notes to one who wrung them all from Thrace;
The trail of turds finds those who found them turds.
  The themes, like those who sing them, raise a din
That they burn out who smoldered, never burned;
That they will end, who do not dare begin;
That death with sword is all the saber earned.
The page is not original, just sin,
Nor all of that invests the voice returned.

ballplayer, hit 66th the other day.

Terrorists succeed before
any dissent is forbidden;
divide and conquer still

I hear 'Canuck" yelled at my
childhood name by Irish
kids I thought smelled bad.
I punch an Eyetralian because
he mocks my Eire chin.
I think Polack because my
aunt uses that term which
does not seem to fit my
best buddy, Gerry Novicki
who covers my back when
bully boys pick on girls who
dare fight back...;> I hear
Falwell-Robertson lump me
with their labels and fear a

too big for its britches...;>

Between tribe, religious identity

of course George's hat

Brian Lamb interviewed the
author of " The Business of America"
a writer for American Heritage
who fielded questions adroitly,
practiced and so sure of himself.
I heard his right and wrong parts.

That I watched this shows me I am
the same as different others 
who know something smells bad
even when a Bette Midler makes 
tears whenever she sings that 
song, or several others,  like the
night Johnny Carson said goodbye.
I decide I won't watch that
in Yankee Stadium as I have 
cried enough already.

It was my glasses they hated,
now that I think of it. Four Eyes
and Professor put me in my place
until I punched some in the nose
and ran for it. Later, I learned they
could all be bought with stolen
money. No one said Four Eyes
or Canuck to the one giving them
change for a movie. Their comfort
mattered more than any ethic.

They reverted to type when funds
stopped flowing and they were
bored. I noted that. I liked them
anyway as I may not be that 
different when pushed against a wall.

Strange Fruit comes to mind.
We all share the tree and eat thereof.
There is no end to it; it blooms every
year because we water and feed it.

As SL mentioned: who controls
the wordprocessors controls the words
which reminded me of Stalin for some
reason, wise guy that mass murderer
or at least no dummy re: propaganda
and bully-boy tactics. Pinochet pales.

As Dennis dared suggest; religion 
may be a generic term for we who
pay attention to politics and culture
as if little else matters, but it does.

Pale gold splashes dot high columned dome,
Playful echoes, lark and laughter rescinds
Pondered yellow Oak's endless silence bends
To leaping children's giggling myotome.
Enter a dozen who yearn to imbibe,
Flirt with the swing but now above its bribe,
Cautiously aimless wanders the Peacock Tribe.
Huddling the monkey bars near playground's end,
Halflings full grown halt yet awaiting license,
Lush lithe bodies in turns display the tense
Ripened fruit, judged judging messages to send,
Whispered falter of family's perigee;
Trailing between progenitor and progeny,
No secrets yet gleaned for promised destiny.

I worry such glory hooked, yet unrooted
(You could lift your leg and the connection is gone)
Could hold things like feet in such tenuous grab.

Scratching at grass with your rake, at your side
Through the folds of wool with your gloves, at the air
With yet another breath -- another draw of deadness,
You withdraw with the leaves again to the pile.

And you stand for a moment with the leaves.
I am watching it all from the window, and something
Says we once could be trees, so close to the earth --
And then we once could pull our legs from the soil.

I am glad to see you step again.

brownish white,
heaped swarming

The stainless utensils
dissecting the evening light
into thin shreds

toyed with

The day was eaten
as though consumed alive,
a squirming intestine
filled with digested time,
engorged and inflamed
in its harbouring
a parasitic decay,
that decompositor
into gurgling sewage
of residual meanings,
a peristalsis of glossolalia,
some pieces of sounds
left scattered about
the way rags are left
torn and scattered about.
Some of those soiled,
bandages from wounds,
that become cavernous 
openings into mechanisms
that betray 
their serial numbers
and places of manufacture,
nothing much else,
of anything, 
and patched together 
into a convincing camouflage

               JUSTICE
          By ... Steve Lucky

A moral code shared by all,
One instinctively seems to know.
Teaching the difference between right and wrong
Allows this moral code to grow.
When kind and innocent people suffer
From the wicked who want to exploit them or worse,
A justice system is brought into power,
To the villians a solider, to the victims a nurse.
No justice system perfectly enforces
The unwritten moral code.
Innocent people are wrongly convicted
While guilty ones never carry the load.
Justice sometimes can be found
By the parents or by the courts.
Sometimes one's own conscience prevents
Enjoyment of ill gotten goods of all sorts.
Other times justice has to come
From those who are willing to take action.
Their system also is imperfect,
But justice is their main attraction.
Without a perfect justice system,
The weight is given to defense
Because injustice only prospers
When justice becomes too intense.

Won't you please

Or is it just a game?

Walking down a busy street

The ever changing view
still always looks the same.
The sun, the dark

The buildings fall.
Rebuild them all.
When you're done
Just tear the whole thing down again
Anything except return
to how things used to be.
That's gone and never can return
trapped in a memory.
A genie with no wishes left
no one can ever free.

Against the owie.  Who cares to endure
The fitless sword, who hears the perfect lure
In saints that epics carefully embalm
To practice in the mouth, the parlor's calm,
Its lion skin become the Kitty's purr?
  Set then to music, epic wants me dance
Not with the sword, but with the girl who sings,
To question lung, investigate her pants,
Believe what lives in Air must beat with wings
While untouched phrases grow up into cants
As lyre and sword forget their fingerings.

Ashcroft's title: "Terrorist Aliens"
  (or did he say: Alien Terrorists?)
suggests "Men from Mars" starring Jack Nichols
  (sporting mad-face from the Stephen King film
   where he froze-nuts on Dixville-Notch's skis
   and battle-hacked his way from room to room
   until trapped in cold storage, he shattered)
can't keep us safe from tail-bound Boogie-Tribes
  wearing light sheets like those some grew up with.

Elsewhere, Bush-keepers block legal release
  of Presidential Papers for twelve years
  (protects his father and recycled aides,
   cripples his predecessor from proving
   he's not solely to blame for maniacs
   and ensures historians get no facts
   related to destruction of records
   maintained by CIA at WTC
   until 11 September this year)

Executive Orders chill follow-up
  by journalists and citizens who'll ask:
  with so many foiled, why was this allowed
  at a time deemed beneficial by pols
  having the most to gain, the least to lose
  from creating crises in confidence
  about "it's the economy, stupid"
  and making it read: "let's get more nuclear"
  "let's drill in ANWR and kill 'all' forests"
  "let's make money with old friends in Saudi"
  "let's give folks new crusades,  'evil-doers'  
    and flag-waving feelings to attend church"
  "cancel privacy, it's over-rated"
  "support the oil-drug-chemical donors:
    be sick, be scared, huddle at home, take pills"
  "resurrect yourselves, fly, shop and buy lots" 
  "retool defense; stop corporate taxes,
    restore interest earned on deficit bonds, 
    ensure no tax funds flow for heir's future, 
    but seek reelection for Daddy's boy.

One may just admire strategy, tactics
  and agenda for an Apocalypse
  designed by born-agains for The Rapture;
or hope Laws of Unintended Consequences will prevail
  as Hubris gets handled in the usual manner by gods
  who helped humans learn: there are no "accidents"
  cause and effect occur in this universe, naturally,
  read wiser men's words: you are not Aliens in your Cosmos,
  but ashcrofts and religionists are truly Man's Terrorists.

A long time ago in my life a woman
told me something--
(Maybe you also know her,
her name shows up, even as a dedication for a building,
with her building-mogul husband,
both friends of mine, more
my parents' friends and of their lifetime.)
She said: Stevie, you never know someone
until you do business with them
or sleep with them.
I still see her now and again
despite her wealth or mine.
She was right, such a simple truth.
But I did not develop to do business
and I have slept with some too late sometimes
and much too long.
So the aphorism has not been apt for me.
I would add that you can know someone
by the way they cut their hotcakes,
though I don't know what it means.

wakin' up the sun's old rays
crushing a leaf in my hand

Some old sun named Ray
An old son of the sun named Ray
Ray hangs laughing from a branch
And drops into the heap of leaves
These leaves are all sons of the sun
Sons and daughters of Ray and June
Sunshine and Ray, laughing in the fall
They fall to the ground, laughing and sighing

The leaves are laughing at the blower
Raimundo the Blowerman laughing on the grass
The Blowerman gives her a little more gas
Plants of one million years ago
Rise in blue smoke, accomplices,
Killers of the leaves of today
The murderers of today's leaves
Today leaves white gas smoke behind
White gas smoke in the old sun
Where's all those ancient sunrays now?
Prisoners in the dark
Locked up in oil and gasoline deposits
Yellow sunbirds covered in oil
Bright orange fires in the Middle East
As the sun goes down orange behind
Put out by the firemen of the far West

The Blowerman cuts the engine
And sits down for lunch in the leaves.

What muted horn with casual grace fills his space with mastering glee
Whose easy voice floats down the dark and distant stair
Follows listeners to shadowed cellar where untended leases
Lie strewn amid tarnished trophies scattered in ancient debris?

Finds knotted Listeners bonded shamefully in self tied ribbon;
The binding liens of despair.
Besieged in the beast's own lair, deaf to the musiced air,
Hiding from the borrowed strength, loaned against the morrow's sin,
Forever hostage listener isolated in basement's deepest room
Encased in deadly proofing silence sealed, yet hears the melody begin
Dancing brassy voice shatters quiet musty gloom,
Filters narrow breaches to untangle unforgotten debt
To beat the contract to its term to cheat the debtors doom
Against the muffling silent wind his ringing voice is set
He is daring you to dare; using freedom to beat the tomb
To lift you up above yourself and to cheat the still night air.

The nerveless calm of disassociation--
that frozen moment when the mirrors parallel,

unravel and the kindertotenlieder swells
like a grim swoon in the alto strings--
all but catatonic, talking fast,
my pieces fly away like rays of light.
The world grows vast,
but no one's in it, and in spite
of all I do or say, the sickle swings,
scythe-whispering its song of doom.
The grass lives short and I am grass
warped to the long strings of the unseen loom.
Light lives long and I am glass,
unseeing, helpless, seeing things.

                 GOAL
          By ... Steve Lucky

Many people have goals they want to achieve
No matter what others say or believe.
Completing a project, passing a test,
Doing required chores, and setting a personal best
Are just come of the goals people set.
One wants to succeed without regret.
Examine the goal to make sure it is wise
For any goal of any size.
Time should not be spent on the completion
Of something that later requires deletion.
When the proper goal is found
A course should be set to gain solid ground.
Time and effort will always be needed.
Crops grow best in the ground best seeded.
Some goals are more difficult than others.
If the goal is too hard, who ever recovers?
Goals going beyond what one can own
Should not be attempted alone.
Friends, neighbors, people inspired,
Aquiantances, strangers, and help that is hired
Play their part in getting the job done,
But the goal will still depend on one.

     NON-TERMINATING, NON-REPEATING
           By ... Steve Lucky

All I know, I think, continues to expand
Where the focus includes direction towards diversity.
For it all includes some simple to notice,
Hard for all to solidly establish,
Ideas inevitably creating patterns.
When I establish, through a system
Complexly directing the pattern which I never completed,
Plots focused on perfecting whatever pattern best maintains
This path still dependent on the irrational number,
Anywhere I travel some unimportant events
To inactive people of uncreative mindsets
Maintains increased priority created to discover
Completely the idea created to guess the main goal.
I, a drifter, eventually decide pattern visiblity.

cusp or threshold in this month

A season for homebodies, their touching pleasures

Irons
-----

To find there are no irons,
no irons in the fire,
only search again
for that better kind of ore,
leaves a skin of rust
a pallor of the blood,
and all that's emptied out
as solitary a passage
as is an emptied drum.

Nothing more than hidden scars,
to take the iron's brand, 
what else remains 
remains unbranded
no signs of knowing,
what makes desirable,
a commodity
made into real demands.

Hard pressed,
under the iron,
a kind of cautery,
to get all the wrinkles out,
and cannot ever make it
smooth enough,
along the furrows 
of the mind.

Everything is overwraught,
brought down, around,
under the hammer,
it's all sold off,
it's long sold out,
the metal pounded,
grown thinner now,
it's stretched and torn,
beaten into shape
until no shape at all.

The new torturer 
has irons in the fire,
and proceeds with breaking 
all that can be broken,
stopping short 
only of bones,
constantly a threat
to silence each expression,
blind the vision,
and bind with new regrets.

No irons in the fire here,
everything's made cold,
the new made into old,
it was all taken
down to dead
the way it was before, 
to crumbling embers 
of what some believed 
was once their hope.

never yearn to live
fighting each other

day to day.

We should kill the last flickering smile
the last hopeful heart
that tries to turn things upside down
and see the candle
instead of the darkness
that surrounds its fragile flickering flame
that any fool can blow out
in a mad rampage.

For we are enemies to each other
every last one of us
cursed souls
damned beyond salvation
walking this earth
like zombies do
in our sick

We should nuke the christians

chinese, japanese
and african too.

We should jump in to the blade
boldly
like the heroes we love to praise
for their killing sprees
in the foreign country

do not feel any pain.

We should let the madness out of its skull jar
let it paint everything in blood
rip out the intestines
and put in the dirt

to make a
everlasting

Spangled painted cave , bison fixed
For time to see .
Linseed and turpentine not waiting ,
Metal oxides fused to rock, original
Burnt sienna. Herds to eat , herds to wear ,
Herds to paint.

Faithless

The core is rotten!
Real thoughs forgotten!
A child of sin...
...can never win.

Halt their attack!
Fight it back!
The mind is free...
...and should forever be.

Fight the sadness!
Stop the madness!
If we stay strong...
...will doomsday never come.


Yet another scribble done in a long boring class at school.  This one is 
at least highly personal ;)

               REPAIRS
          By ... Steve Lucky

Car repairs are a large expense
The fustrations they cause can be quite intense.
Home repairs cost even more
To leave things the way they were before.
Computer repairs work their way
Into major expenses one has to pay.
Less expensive things sometimes break down too,
So we buy a replacement, sometimes two.
Without water or electricity no one dares
Neglect the importance of repairs.
It is them one will realize
Why some people specialize
In fixing things when they break down.
Every person in every town
Has plenty of things used every day
Which even when used in the most careful way
Will stop functioning without warning
And need to be used before the next morning.
For imperfect things it is guaranteed
Repairs are something one will always need.

i hate the smell of cigarettes, the way they sting my eyes, the way they
make the small lizard-brain part of my skull panic that the house might
burn at any moment. but i can't stop admiring the slant of his elbows, his
whole body relaxing against the hood of his beat up rust box, and the
small haloes he makes for fallen angels, out here, in the evening snow.

(not) missing the moon

the moon is there
yet some nights the sky is black
no sliver c no glob D
he plays for the flipside of earth
and cannot escape uncertainty
phases of odd theories
how he appears
little talk of lovers basking in his spell
the moon is there
tonight he'll be back

Dark glow


Incendiary emotions
Come alive through the dinner table.
Jealousy,

From a smouldering cauldron of carnage,
Tastes good in small portions of
Passion.

On a secret bed of bestiality,
Two lovers will become tormentors
Tonight.

No curious, innocent eyes will see.
No sensitive, blameless ears will hear
The truncated voices of
A love in pain.

Romance in Country 

Rayette's overpouting lips cooed round
I'll do anything you want if
you'll only love me Lucky for
me she can't pronounce womanizer

Rayette was working Denny's mopping floors
vacuumed mudroom floormats straightened them
took out trash and freshened up the rest rooms
we met I went there cause they featured entrees
chicken cordon bleu--French stuff
and boocoo freshly brewed coffee that

Kept me up all night watching cotton balls
between her toes at the place we shared
where she also mopped and vacuumed
scrubbed the sink and toilet rim took out
the trash plus dusted did the dishes
slung hash also complained we never talk
So I go What and she goes
You won't ever leave me will you all the time we talk
but I keep going back
they're her CDs  her stereo her TV set
her beer and where I can work on the car

Or Not.
Can't go trick or treating, the world could end tonite
The silence is dull around this house
Dustin said I should come over and watch tv.
While I play with his trouser snake.

I said no and that is gross.
So he asked Jessica and she said yes.
Teggie wanted me to be a designated driver.
And I wasn't invited to a party.

At least I bought my own chocolate.

I'm just pretending
everyday of my life
not sure of who I am
or what I think is right

I'm still re-inventing myself
Am I a cynic or a sweetheart?
A vixen or the girl next door?

I'm trying to fit in
but I'm trying to not
can't trust myself
can't trust my thoughts

What all this means

Mel Brooks Takes On Anthrax Anxiety

Anthrax, the new acute Anxiety
  (unlike the High kind Mel Brooks made famous)
promises to solve long standing problems
  (arising from wars not won by drug czars)
relative to crack-cocaine addiction
  (crystal-meth crumbs or finely milled powders)
Columbians produce for The Stupid
  (with cooperation from The Greedy)
whose skill with bags, pipes, razors and mirrors 
  (with group acquiescence of the Needy)
is legend beyond neighboring borders
  (where Catholic population growth soars)
having no contraception they speak of
  (no abortion, ever, sayeth The Pope)
in polite society where demand
  (bishops dictate family size, of course)
meets supply on an economic curve
  (pastors preach: be fruitful and multiply)
papered white in the plans of dictators
  (curates forgive weekly "fess-up" lapses)
joined at the hip to 'melican bankers
  (nuns use prevention "just in case" for rapes)
employing those able to avoid traps
  (natives earn little; none dare unionize)
joining those able to afford lawyers
  (no child labor, environmental laws)
but God is not mocked, so rumor has it
  (the poor know about good gallows humor)
and His Son could change water into wine
  (the poor collect dust near dead animals)
surely, God could kill two birds with one stone
  (UN drops boxes of envelopes, pens)
some say: God works in mysterious ways
  (missionaries taught youngsters to read, write)
"His wonders to behold" governs bold acts
  (oldsters sell the coke elsewhere as Futures)
He leadeth all souls beside still waters
  (the downtrodden replace the dictators)
He permits shipment of replacement goods
  (nouveau riche, not meek, inherit the earth)
the unaware sing: God blessed His Children
  (addicts chant: open the envelope, please)
there's peace on earth; blind Justice's scale swings
  (Brooks rewrites his play: "High Anxiety")
new Broadway hit outsells "The Producers"
  (God's well-seated because it's Who You Know)
theater-goers bow toward a Queen's White Glove
  (all open programs; dust flies; she sneezes)
in one voice, the audience shouts: God Bless . . .

Commemoration
-------------

The distant insect hum
grows into a bone rattle
of machines,
thumping at the heart
of the land,
breaking everything up,
the way a defibrillator thumps
at a heart attack,
until you hear the pounding
deadening the ear drums,
making the mind recoil,
from a constant series
of muffled explosions.

The future never known as anything
except as a groping dark
where everything is slowly broken
down along the way,
siezed up, and frozen,
in between various monuments
erected to commemorate
all those other dead ends,
beyond anything more immanent
other than cold sepulchre rooms,
limed white and smoothed over 
the way ancient graves contained
various forms of personal decomposition.

We rifle through the artifacts
that we are left behind
looking for something 
that we can decipher,
looking for a relic,
a piece of skin, or a bone,
the quick glance of an eye,
something that has an answer 
written upon it,
yet we find nothing of the sort
that would really tell us,
in any kind of language,
what the whole project is about.

We gather up our remaining stories,
as something we try to hold onto,
finding very little else,
that anyone would let us keep,
kept moving along
one struggle to the next,
time being consumed
in the minutae of  routines
that prevent any living of dreams.
If we could only escape,
in a plan, a scheme, a way,
towards what we always wanted
and never really had any of.

IKEA Sunrise

Always we come home with something
even if it's just a tchotchkeh.
"I think it would accent the Kimstas, don't you?"
"Do you, Baby? Do you want it?"
"Not really, only you, before and after."
"I'm listening, Baby, I am, just drive,
I won't talk, but I'll, um, I can hum, um, okay?" 
"Without an SUV we're limited, dependent on our friends"
"(HhMM mm) mMllp--but, Baby, our Impala has a bench seat.
(mmM Mmm hnm)."
"The leaves have lost their colors, just a three-week autumn binge,
a visual and contrapuntal echo of the spring
and its fragrant lilac tease."
"(mnN)--glupp, those armmm different, Baby."
"I know but I thought of it."
"(umm mm umm MMM)."
"I couldn't take those pictures, Baby, shots of Mars like that,
the kind of money that it costs."
"(tssspp)--don't buy an SUV, we'll keep our nice Impala."
"They could never do it if we didn't give them money,
one-third of our earnings, Baby oh god I love you
minerals and chemicals they're looking for on Mars
they'll yes god yes they'll own it all
we pay them trillions and get Gore-Tex or some Tang."
"Some Tang? You're funny, Baby, I love you."
